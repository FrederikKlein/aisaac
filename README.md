# aisaac
> **ðŸ”®** *An Intelligent Screening Assistant for Academic Content*

aisaac is a tool designed to assist researchers and academics in screening and evaluating academic papers. By defining custom criteria, users can efficiently sift through large volumes of academic content to find papers that are most relevant to their research. Additionally, aisaac offers capabilities to evaluate its performance and optimize criteria based on user-provided ground truth.

## Features
- **Document Reading**: Automatically reads and preprocesses academic papers.
- **Criteria Evaluation**: Evaluates papers against user-defined criteria to determine relevance.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Assesses the tool's performance using provided ground truth.
- **Criteria Optimization**: Improves criteria based on performance evaluation for more accurate future screenings.
- **User Interface**: Offers a user-friendly interface for interaction with the tool.

## Installation

Before installing `aisaac`, ensure you have a compatible Python version installed. Python >= 3.9 is required. The system was tested on Python 3.10 though.
Then, follow these steps:

1. Clone the `aisaac` repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FrederikKlein/aisaac.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd aisaac
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
`aisaac` can be used as a python package or through its graphical user interface (GUI).

### Python Package
To use `aisaac` as a python package, import the `aisaac` module and use its classes and functions as needed. 
The core classes are
- 'Screener'
- 'Evaluator'
- 'Optimizer'

To organize contexts, the core classes use a context manager that is filled with default values. The context manager can be used to set custom values for the classes.
To do so, first import the context manager:
```python
from aisaac.aisaac.utils.context_manager import ContextManager
```
Then, create a context manager object and set custom values:
```python
cm = ContextManager()
cm.set_config('RAG_MODEL', "mixtral:latest")
cm.set_config('RESULT_FILE', "results.csv")
cm.set_config('CHECKPOINT_DICTIONARY', checkpoint_dict)
```
Finally, pass the context manager object to the core classes and run the desired functions. For example, to create a new screener object with custom values, use the following code snippet:
```python
screener = Screener(context_manager=cm)
screener.do_screening()
```
All the configuration options of the context manager can be found in the [Context Manager Documentation](docs/context_manager.md) TODO.



### Graphical User Interface
To use `aisaac` via the graphical user interface, run the following command:
   ```bash
   streamlit run uisaac.py
   ```
