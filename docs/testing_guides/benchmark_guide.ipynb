    "Welcome to the interactive testing notebook for `aisaac`, An Intelligent Screening Assistant for Academic Content. This notebook is designed to guide you through the process of testing `aisaac` under various configurations, particularly focusing on its integration with different Language Learning Models (LLMs).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook aims to:\n",
    "- Demonstrate how to perform basic and advanced tests on `aisaic`.\n",
    "- Guide users through creating their own tests for custom configurations.\n",
    "- Offer executable examples that illustrate `aisaac`'s compatibility and performance with a variety of LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive into the testing procedures, please ensure you have the following prerequisites satisfied:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Python Installation**: Ensure you have Python >= 3.9 installed on your system. This notebook was tested with Python 3.10.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Project Setup**: If you haven't already, clone the `aisaac` repository and navigate to its root directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    git clone <repository-url>\n",
    "    cd aisaac\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required dependencies by running the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    Make sure to \n",
    "    a. have Ollama and all the LLMs that you want to test locally installed (in Ollama) or\n",
    "    b. have the LLMs that you want to test available in the cloud (via Xinference)"
